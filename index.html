        <div class="boxed">The clich&eacute; of the nerdy kid who doesn&#39;t go outside and just plays games is
            completely
            untrue. And
            it&#39;s also untrue for the nerdy kid who studies comic books and turns into this genius, and it is also
            untrue for the
            nerdy kid who listens to every nerdy thing that Led Zeppelin put out. That kind of obsession in a
            16-year-old is not ugly.
            It&#39;s beautiful. That kind of obsession is going to lead to a sophisticated 30-year-old who has a
            background in that
            artform.

        </div>
        <div class="main">I am someone who had to be told as a child that no, I couldn't upgrade the family computer. I
            am someone who was learning to build and overclock their PC in junior high. I am someone who nearly cried
            when a family friend heard I was building a computer and gifted me an Intel Core2Quad Q6600. I am someone
            who triple boots, who compiles from source, and who thinks an evening spent comparing virtualized
            environments is as fun as going to any bar.
            <br/>
            <br/>I am an obsessive. Computers have been my life since I was old enough to be trusted with one. In that
            time I've built several of my own, several more for clients. I find zen in the challenge of troubleshooting
            and massive joy in finding a solution. When I learned there was more to life than Windows I jumped at the
            chance to explore a new world called Linux. When I learned there was a class of computers beyond the
            desktop, I spent days planning resource management between a handful of Virtual Private Servers. When I
            learned what network topologies were I sprang up and bought enough RAM to host a dozen concurrent networked
            VMs on my personal desktop. When I learned there were more mobile operating systems than just Android, iOS,
            and Windows I immediately began looking for a test phone to try Sailfish, Firefox OS, and Ubuntu Touch.
            <br/>
            <br/>It's a love that extends to all technology. I remember being a toddler and running thrilled down the
            sidewalk at Cape Canaveral to see a model of the Mars rover Spirit. I remember being in elementary school
            and begging my family for a Lego Mindstorms robotics kit for Christmas, and spending the next several months
            playing with it daily, building new robots and learning to program them. Today I'll read through Elon Musk's
            Hyperloop proposal with a racing heart, feeling electrified by the science and engineering and just how
            freaking cool it was. I'll wake up at 2AM to watch a space launch and feel crushed if the mission is
            scrubbed, or gaze at the gimbaling engines in amazement if rocket takes off. I watch Formula 1 religiously
            after seeing an engineer explain the aerodynamic principles and the technology in the engine.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            What I'm trying to say is that if I'm offering to work for you, then I'm offering to give you everything I
            have. All my passion for what I love and what I do can be a resource that I promise you won't find anywhere
            else.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Let me use my passion to be the best intern you've ever hired.
