    <p>No matter how many times it has been brought up, a large percentage of ticket submissions would come in with no identifying information on the affected workstation. Growing frustrated, I took matters into my own hands. I wrote a set of functions to search the organization's file servers for connected users and their respective connected IPs. Since every user accesses at least one file share, this was a fairly reliable method of discovery. And since it didn't rely on querying neighboring workstations, it was significantly faster than methods like PSTools' <code>PSLoggedOn.exe</code>.
