    <h2 style="font-weight: 700">Linux KVM hypervisor with KVM/Qemu Windows instance using IOMMU</h2>

    <p>A typical workstation machine running Arch Linux as the host alongside a Windows VM via KVM/Qemu. IOMMU
        (Input/Output Memory Management Unit) allows certain hypervisors to take control of assigned hardware
        devices including PCI controllers. In this application I pass a discrete GPU to the Windows VM which
        allows up to 95% of the native graphical performance within the VM enabling certain GPU intensive tasks
        such as gaming, video rendering, and hardware accelerated decode of very high resolution video. The two
        machines run concurrently with each GPU connected to its own monitor.
