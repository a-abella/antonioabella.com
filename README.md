personalsite
============

A personal website written in simple HTML and CSS to host a bio, a resume, docs, and contact info.


It's a website, and probably made using terrible practices. What more do you need from me?
Colors inspired by the Monokai text editor theme. Typefaces by Google Fonts using Open Sans
and Montserrat. I should probably learn javascript and use it for something.
